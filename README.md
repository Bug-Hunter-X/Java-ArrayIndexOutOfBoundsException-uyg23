This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common error: "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException". The program attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, leading to a runtime exception.  The solution provides a corrected version of the code, illustrating how to avoid this type of error. The solution is based on using '<' instead of '<=' in the for loop condition.
